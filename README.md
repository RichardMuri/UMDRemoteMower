All code in RPi/ is meant to be run on a Raspberry Pi 2. All code in ESP8266/ is targetted for an ESP-01 Wifi module. The Wifi module communicates with the Pi via serial connection. More information can be found in our final report.

Xbox-Controller/ contains a Visual Studio project targetted for a Windows device. Xbox-Controller/xbox 3/bin/debug/xbox 3.exe is the only file necessary if the goal is merely to run the program. An Xbox 360 controller and the .NET framework, along with a Wifi transceiver are required for use.
